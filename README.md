# Computer-Craft-AutoMiner

Simple program to use multiple turtles to mine entire chunks within seconds using the ComputerCraft mod

install by writing **pastebin run FX1XJWds** in the shell and selecting if the shell is a client (miner) or the server 

a **advanced** turtle is required; a normal one doesnt work

a rednet modem is also required for communication between turtles and gps location
